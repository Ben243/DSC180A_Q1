# Q1 Project Report: Determining Packet Loss and Latency Through Network Capture Data

This repository contains code made in relation to a machine learning model that determines a packet loss ratio and degree of latency that has to be determined given a short snippet of simulated network traffic metadata. 

## Targets
Each of these targets implements a core feature of the repository within ```run.py```.
- ```etl```: Generates a transformed feature dataset of data that comes from all data placed in the directory ```data/raw```, and outputs a single csv to ```data/out``` of the features and multiple temporary csv's in ```data/temp``` for manual inspection of the transformed data.
- ```eda```: Generates visualizations used in exploring which features to use for the model
- ```train```: trains a model to predict latency and packet loss with the output of etl. The trained model pipelines corresponding to their output of packet loss/latency are saved to a ```.pkl``` file within the directory ```model```
- ```metrics```: Generates relevant visualizations used in measuring model performance on a benchmark featureset
- ```clean```: Cleans commonly used files generated by targets ```etl```, ```eda```, ```train```, and ```metrics```
- ```test```: Verifies target functionality by running the targets ```clean```,```etl```, ```train```, and ```metrics```
- ```all```: runs all targets except ```test```

Example call: ```python run.py clean etl train metrics``


## Usage Instructions

1. Generate data using [DANE](https://github.com/dane-tool/dane)

2. Clone this branch of the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ben243/DSC180A_Q1/tree/justin_branch
   ```

3. Place all raw DANE csv files within the directory ```data/raw``` of this repository. If the directory has not been created, run the command ```run.py``` once to generate all relevant directories.

4. Run the following command if you have new data you would like to train a new model on:
   ```
   python run.py all
   ```
   Run the following command if only you wish to verify all target functionality:
   ```
   python run.py test
   ```
